# User Experience

### Introduction

The main feature of a video platform for a viewer or videographer is the user experience. The videographer must be able to manage his content without problem and use tools available to manage and animate his community. YouTube provides many tools to help content creators deliver quality work and manage their audience. The experience of viewing video on the Internet has deteriorated much in recent years largely due to advertisements.

### A new tool for videographers?

The main goal of Dreamvo is to create a platform that drastically changes the way of sharing, broadcasting and watching audiovisual content through a free and decentralized network. We want to allow creators to maximize the quality of their content. With the help of the economic model, we will move towards a platform where quality work is mostly rewarded by the spectators themselves.

### Promote mutual help and sharing

On YouTube there are already features that allow viewers to contribute to the development of a channel, the best known being the contribution of subtitles. There is also the possibility to add moderators for the comment space of a channel, allowing a more regular moderation. And if we pushed the concept even further? And if multiple users could manage a single channel, with specific roles? Or even multiple users who manage the same video.

### Effective navigation

We also want to improve the way we navigate through the content. The viewer must be able to choose what he wants to watch, and even what he wants to find on the platform when he connects. He must be able to navigate the platform without interrupting his viewing, can organize the display of his newsfeed as he wishes and find his favorite videos in just a few clicks.
