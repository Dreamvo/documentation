# Video moderation

To guarantee a good user experience on our platform we need to moderate the posted content. We have to be able to detect explicit or offensive content as fast as possible. Our community regulation will ban some kinds of content and we will be able to verify it manually.

Thanks to algorithms and AI it is possible to analyse the content and learn how to be efficient to impose a strict guideline for all users. The main content to detect and punish are pornography, offensive content, violent or including inapropriate words (racism, harassment, ...).

However we can't fully replace human moderation, which wil always be more efficent than automated analysis which can draw us into censorship.
