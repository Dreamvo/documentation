# License

Dreamvo is a free and open source project. We chose the **GNU Affero General Public License** (AGPL). It is for free software under copyleft. Its terms are actually those of the GPLv3, with an obligation to keep the code public and modified remotely. This license is recommended for software which run on a network.

The public general license GNU Affero (GNU AGPL) is a modified version of the version 3 of the ordinary GNU GPL. It has an only one more demand : if you run a program modified on a server and let other users communicate with it, your server has to let users download the source code of the current functional modified version.

### What is copyleft ?

« Copyleft » is a pun referring to « copyright ». However, Copyleft is absolutely different from Copyright.

In a nutshell, copyleft is a general method to make a software free (or any other project) and force every version of this program to be open source. Furthermore, copyleft allows developpers to contribute to the open source project.
