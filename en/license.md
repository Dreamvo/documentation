Dreamvo is a free and open source project. We chose the **GNU Affero General Public License** (AGPL). It is for free software under copyleft.

The public general license GNU Affero (GNU AGPL) is a modified version of the version 3 of the ordinary GNU GPL. It has an only one more demand : if you run a program modified on a server and let other users communicate with it, your server has to let users download the source code of the current functional modified version.<br>
